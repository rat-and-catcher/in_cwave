in_cwave V1.*.* (Unpublic!) Versions History -- see OLD_NEWS

25-Sep-2016 -- V2.0.0 -- The first V2.0.0 Release. Changes from V1.5.0:
        Shift / Harmonic PM / Mix / Master DSP Node types.
        "Bugs control" window as in V1.5.0 (WAV/RWAVE support, save config
        on unload, Sleep() on playback timing).
        1-st touch to unstableness of standard Noise Shaping loop.
        +Dithering, +Noise Shaping (F-w, mE-w, iE-w); +Quantize type;
        -unused Load/Save buttoms. BSD-Like license. Comments slightly fixed;
        +Corosschannel exchange, +Spectrum inversion (old configs incompatible now!);
        +Setting exact values for modulation parameters;
        (== NOW WE HAVE ALGORITHMICALLY FULL MODULATOR);
        +controlled 'long numbers' in setup dialog;
        +versioning of config (weak solution, but better than nothing) and "About";
        lots of small improvements in different places; the code in general
        looks rather ugly, but less ugly than in V1.4.*-.
        OLD_NEWS and CHANGELOG files.
        Move VC2013 projects files to ./MSVC2013
        +CodeBlocks projects (MinGW GCC 4.9.2) +corresponding compatibility .h-files.
19-May-2017 -- V2.1.0 - FOUND FATAL BUG IN PHASE COMPUTATION -- ONLY INTEGER Fm WORK!!
        Temporary fix it. Replace all <TABS> to spaces in src/*.
15-May-2020 -- V2.2.0 - Add optional floating point checks for all of the IIR filters and
        sound rendering computations;
        Lots of Shibata's noise shapers added (now all known 14 FIR-based shapers total);
        Some IIR NS filters (44K and 48K Gesemann);
        Small fix in xwave_read_samples()@xwave_reader.c and some very small fixes.
09-Jun-2020 -- V2.2.1 - fix bug @ xwave_reader.c -- fail/crash on wav-files with
        metadata between 'fmt ' and 'data'.
27-Jun-2020 -- V2.2.2 - more clean reading audiodata samples; some small fixes;
        attempt to cleanup the comments (generally unsuccessful). Update doc.
03-Jul-2021 -- V2.2.3 - add peak levels in dB along with clip counters;
        add DSP-list global bypass;
        take more care to volatile double copying together with
        defining DBL_COPY_FAST project preprocessor definition;
        Default gain for mod/mix nodes now 1.0 (Master stay 0.8);
        Different configurations for "plain build" (Windows VIsta+) ans Windows XP;
        MinGW/Code::Blocks XP build don't support UTF-16LE configs.
21-Jul-2021 -- V2.3.0 - Add per-track reseting of sample counter and analitic converter;
        Add optional track time aligment and fade in / fade out;
        Fix insufficient 32-bit resolution of frame counter to 64 bit (it was an 'almost bug');
        Fix "-EMPTY-" to last played file name (_should_ to work;
        wery odd area in WinAmp spesc);
        Try to update "Bugs control" numerical parameters by "OK";
        Change Microsoft's __int64 and somewhere unsigned/int to <stdint.h> types;
        Rename DBL_COPY_FAST to ATM_COPY_FAST.
01-Aug-2023 -- V2.3.1 -- Recalculate HB LPF IIR filters by DSPL-2, add 3 new IIR
        designs ("Ugly filters"); add Kahan summation for the filters.
31-Oct-2023 -- V2.4.0 -- Add (I+Q)/2 (def. now) and (I-Q)/2 as Master Node output variants;
        add subnorm rejection to zero in IIR LPF implementation and corresponding
        statistics, move Kahan setup to "Bugs control", some GUI rearrange;
        fix saving config for the 1st time run when config file not exist;
        add ability to reduce output significant bits (reduce entropy).
31-Jul-2024 -- V2.4.1 -- minor fixes; add VS 2017/2022 projects.
        No any new fuctionality.
05-Oct-2024 -- V2.4.2 -- SQRT2 divider for I+Q / I-Q; alt. filts. coeffs. set (FP_MIXED),
        some palyback thread fixes. Renew ./Winamp -- Winamp SDK.
14-Nov-2024 -- V2.4.3 -- Fix Playback API encoding Version for new SDK (very tiny and hard
        bug).
15-Apr-2025 -- V2.4.4 -- Minor GUI control logic fixes, add string to sound rendering
        descriprors. Return "" vs "-EMPTY-", if last file name is unknown.
        File infoBox() parenting set for amgui_setup_dialog() only.
        Integer atomic interthreads operations in initial Winamp SDK in-plugin skeliton
        (very old code) + some Pharisaical atomic addons. Lock Winamp from exit while
        working top-level dialogs shown (DOES NOT WORK ON XMPlay). Seems, we lost MinGW
        compatibility.
